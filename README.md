# About this project (still being built)
The system consists of a teaching platform that keeps course information, its classes and students, as well as a forum for questions and answers about the course content.
The actors of the system can be students and teachers. There are also administrator users, who are the only ones authorized to register courses and classes.

A course consists of several “resources”, which are groups of content. These resources can be learning tracks, bonuses, external links, and the course question and answer forum itself. 
Each resource may contain sections, and these sections in turn will contain the lessons, which can be video and/or text content, or tasks to be delivered by students.

A task can have a weight, a delivery date, a number of questions, and the minimum number of hits required to be accepted. 
When a student delivers the task, it is waiting for the teacher’s feedback, and it can be accepted or rejected.

Each new class of the course corresponds to an offer or edition of this course, which has a start and end date. 
Different offers of the same course may have small variations in content, depending on the need for customization for each class.

Users (students and teachers) should receive notifications.

With regard to the question and answer forum, this consists of a collection of topics (with a title and the description of the question), and each topic may have multiple answers. 
The general requirements of the forum are:

- List topics with the following filter options:

    By Appeal / Section / Class

    by text (title and/or body of the topic)

    Questions asked only by the logged user

- Create a topic: title, body

- Reply to Topic

- Mark/delete upvote in question (cannot be the author)

- Mark/delete upvote in response (cannot be the author)

- Mark/delete best answer (only topic author and instructor)
